# Solutions to Your Blockchain Issues

## Problem 1: Transactions Disappearing ✅ FIXED

### What Was Happening
Your blockchain **already had** permanent transaction storage built-in, but there was no REST API endpoint to retrieve all transactions. The transactions were stored permanently in LevelDB but you couldn't easily access them via API calls.

### The Fix
Added two new REST API endpoints to `app.py`:

#### 1. Get All Transactions
```
GET /api/blockchain/transactions?start=0&limit=50
```

**Features:**
- Returns ALL transactions (never deletes any)
- Supports pagination (start and limit parameters)
- Auto-rebuilds transaction indices if needed
- Returns newest transactions first by default
- Shows total count and whether more exist

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "transactions": [...],
  "total": 325,
  "has_more": true,
  "start_index": 0,
  "limit": 50,
  "returned": 50
}
```

#### 2. Get Transactions for Specific Address
```
GET /api/blockchain/transactions/{address}?start=0&limit=50
```

**Features:**
- Shows all transactions where address is sender OR receiver
- Supports pagination
- Validates address format
- Includes direction info (sent/received)

### How It Works
The blockchain stores transactions permanently with multiple indices:
- By transaction hash (for direct lookups)
- By transaction index (for chronological order)
- By sender address (for address history)
- By receiver address (for address history)
- By block number (for block queries)

Transactions are **NEVER deleted**. They persist forever in LevelDB.

## Problem 2: Mining AFC Tokens ✅ DOCUMENTED

### What Was Confusing
AFC tokens aren't "mined" in the traditional sense (like Bitcoin). They are **minted** via a smart contract function.

### The Solution: How to Mint AFC Tokens

AFC tokens are created by calling the Afrocoin smart contract:

#### Method 1: Via REST API
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/contracts/call`

**Request:**
```json
{
  "contract_id": "afrocoin_stablecoin",
  "function_name": "mint_afc",
  "caller": "YOUR_DT_WALLET_ADDRESS",
  "args": {
    "amount": "1000"
  },
  "value": "0"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "result": "Minted 1000 AFC tokens",
  "gas_used": 31000,
  "error": null
}
```

#### Step-by-Step in Postman:

1. **Open Postman and create a new POST request**
   - URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/contracts/call`
   - Method: POST
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`

2. **Add this to the request body:**
```json
{
  "contract_id": "afrocoin_stablecoin",
  "function_name": "mint_afc",
  "caller": "DT1qyfe883hey6jrgj2xvk9a3klghvz9z9way2nxvu",
  "args": {
    "amount": "1000"
  },
  "value": "0"
}
```

3. **Send the request**
   - You should get a success response
   - The AFC tokens are immediately added to your balance

4. **Verify the balance:**
   - URL: `http://localhost:5000/api/blockchain/balance/DT1qyfe883hey6jrgj2xvk9a3klghvz9z9way2nxvu`
   - Method: GET
   - You should see your AFC balance updated

### Available AFC Operations

All done via `POST /api/contracts/call` with different function_name:

1. **mint_afc** - Create new AFC tokens
2. **burn_afc** - Destroy AFC tokens
3. **transfer_afc** - Send AFC to another address
4. **afc_balance_of** - Check AFC balance of any address
5. **afc_total_supply** - Get total AFC in circulation

---

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Get Your First AFC Tokens

```bash
# Step 1: Check initial balance
curl http://localhost:5000/api/blockchain/balance/DT1qyfe883hey6jrgj2xvk9a3klghvz9z9way2nxvu

# Step 2: Mint 1000 AFC tokens
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/contracts/call \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contract_id": "afrocoin_stablecoin",
    "function_name": "mint_afc",
    "caller": "DT1qyfe883hey6jrgj2xvk9a3klghvz9z9way2nxvu",
    "args": {"amount": "1000"}
  }'

# Step 3: Verify balance updated
curl http://localhost:5000/api/blockchain/balance/DT1qyfe883hey6jrgj2xvk9a3klghvz9z9way2nxvu
```

### 2. View All Your Transactions

```bash
# Get all transactions in the blockchain
curl http://localhost:5000/api/blockchain/transactions?limit=100

# Get transactions for specific address
curl http://localhost:5000/api/blockchain/transactions/DT1qyfe883hey6jrgj2xvk9a3klghvz9z9way2nxvu?limit=50
```

2. **POSTMAN_COLLECTION_GUIDE.md** - Complete API testing guide with examples
3. **SOLUTIONS_SUMMARY.md** - This file

### Modified Files:
1. **app.py** - Added two new REST API endpoints:

## Genesis Addresses for Testing

These addresses have pre-allocated funds and can mint AFC freely:

```
DT1qyfe883hey6jrgj2xvk9a3klghvz9z9way2nxvu  - 30M DINARI + 200M AFC
DT1sv9m0g077juqa67h64zxzr26k5xu5rcp8c9qvx  - 25M DINARI
DT1cqgze3fqpw0dqh9j8l2dqqyr89c0q5c2jdpg8x  - 20M DINARI
DT1xz2f8l8lh8vqw3r6n4s2k7j9p1d5g8h3m6c4v7  - 15M DINARI
DT1a7b8c9d0e1f2g3h4i5j6k7l8m9n0o1p2q3r4s5  - 10M DINARI
```

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Transactions are NEVER deleted** - They're stored permanently in LevelDB
2. **AFC tokens are MINTED, not mined** - Use the smart contract call
3. **Blocks are mined automatically** - Every 15 seconds
4. **All APIs support pagination** - Use start and limit parameters
5. **Genesis addresses have special privileges** - Use them for testing

---

## Next Steps

1. Start your blockchain server
2. Open Postman
3. Try the examples in POSTMAN_COLLECTION_GUIDE.md
4. Mint some AFC tokens to your address
5. View all transactions to verify they persist
